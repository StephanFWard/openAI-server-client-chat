# openAI-server-client-chat
  simplified example demonstrating how to use gRPC in Python to create a client-server application where a Python script interacts with the GPT-4 language model hosted on a server

  This example demonstrates a basic client-server interaction using gRPC in Python, where the server uses the GPT-4 language model to generate responses to input text received from the client. You can extend it further by handling multiple concurrent requests, implementing error handling, and integrating with real-world applications.

  Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/openAI-server-client-chat.git

  Install the necessary dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  Set up your OpenAI API key:
  Sign up for an account on the OpenAI platform and obtain an API key.
  Set your API key as an environment variable:
  '''export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key'''

  Start the server by running:
  python server.py.

  In another terminal window, run:
  python client.py.

  You should see the client sending input text to the server, and the server responding with text generated by the GPT-4 model.
